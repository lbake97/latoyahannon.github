            "I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. 

From there I was promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. 

And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparationsâ€¦.I have built my own factory on my own ground."
